I am a PhD student in the department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy. I am advised by [Venkat Viswanathan](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/venkatv/index.html#). I have a Bachelors and Masters in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Bombay, where I was advised by [Prabhu Ramachandran](https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/~prabhu/). 

I currently work on using scientific machine learning to accelerate multiphysics simulations. In the past I've worked on modelling surface tension using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.

My interests broadly lie in the fields of scientific computing, machine learning, PDE solving and fluid dynamics.
